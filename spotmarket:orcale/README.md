# Injective AMMs and Order Books

This repository provides a technical overview of Automated Market Makers and order book based exchanges, with a focus on how Injective natively supports fully on chain order books through its Exchange Module.

## Pre-requisites
 
- Completed day 5 (SDK basics) in this series
- Node.js and npm installed
- Testnet wallet with INJ tokens and USDT tokens

## Automated Market Makers

An Automated Market Maker is a trading mechanism that replaces direct counterparties with a deterministic pricing function. Liquidity is supplied into shared pools by liquidity providers rather than through individual limit orders. Trades execute against the pool according to a predefined mathematical invariant that governs the price curve.

The most common invariant is the constant product formula, where the product of two asset reserves remains constant. Prices are derived from reserve ratios, and each trade shifts the price along the curve. Liquidity providers earn fees proportional to their share of the pool and total trading volume.

AMMs provide continuous liquidity, permissionless access, and deterministic execution. Their limitations include capital inefficiency, increased slippage for large trades, and impermanent loss caused by price divergence from external markets.

## Order Book Based Exchanges

Order book exchanges structure liquidity as discrete buy and sell orders at explicit price levels. Traders submit limit orders that rest in the book or market orders that consume existing liquidity. Matching occurs when bid and ask prices cross, following strict price time priority.

Order books enable accurate price discovery, dense liquidity at competitive price levels, and strong capital efficiency since capital is committed only at selected prices. They support advanced trading strategies including professional market making, arbitrage, and low latency execution.

The primary challenges are higher system complexity, liquidity fragmentation, and historical incompatibility with on chain execution due to latency constraints, gas costs, and state growth.

## Injective Exchange Module and On Chain Order Books

Injective implements fully on chain order books through its native Exchange Module, integrated at the protocol level rather than deployed as a smart contract. Order matching is embedded directly into the blockchain state machine, enabling deterministic execution and high throughput.

The Exchange Module maintains spot and derivatives order books with price time priority enforced at the consensus layer. Orders can be placed, matched, partially filled, or canceled within a single block. Matching logic is executed by validators, ensuring fairness and preventing miner extractable manipulation.

Injective employs a frequent batch auction matching model. All orders submitted within a block are collected, sorted, and matched atomically. This design mitigates front running, improves execution integrity, and aligns trade finality with block finality.

For derivatives markets, margin checks, funding payments, liquidations, and risk controls are integrated directly into the module. This allows Injective to support perpetual and futures markets with native risk management while remaining fully on chain.

By moving the order book and matching engine into the core protocol, Injective achieves the precision and capital efficiency of traditional exchanges while preserving decentralization, composability, and cryptographic settlement guarantees.

## Demos

This repository includes a demo demonstrating how to interact with the Injective Exchange Module using the Injective TypeScript SDK.

See the [spotmarket](./spotmarket/) directory for the complete tutorial on:
- Fetching spot market data
- Understanding market parameters
- Placing limit buy and sell orders
- Querying order status and trade history
- Converting between chain and human-readable formats
- Querying oracle lists and module parameters
- Fetching oracle price feeds for derivative markets

Each demo illustrates different integration paths for developers building on Injective.

---

## Injective Oracle Module

Injective's Oracle Module provides decentralized price feeds at the protocol level. Oracles supply external market data to the chain, enabling derivative markets to reference accurate asset prices for mark pricing, funding rate calculations, and liquidations.

The module supports multiple oracle providers, including Band Protocol, Pyth Network, and Chainlink. Each derivative market is linked to a specific oracle feed defined by its base symbol, quote symbol, and oracle type. This tight integration ensures that on-chain derivatives always have reliable price references without depending on a single external source.

The Oracle Module exposes two primary API surfaces:
- **Chain gRPC Oracle API** (`ChainGrpcOracleApi`): Queries on-chain oracle module parameters and state directly from validators.
- **Indexer gRPC Oracle API** (`IndexerGrpcOracleApi`): Queries aggregated oracle data from the indexer, including oracle lists and price feeds.

### Oracle scripts

The oracle demo scripts are located in the `spotmarket/orc_src/` directory:

- **`fetchorc.ts`**: Fetches the complete list of registered oracles from the Injective mainnet indexer, extracts all distinct oracle types (e.g., Band, Pyth, Chainlink), and queries the chain for oracle module parameters.
- **`fetchpricefeed.ts`**: Looks up the `INJ/USDT PERP` derivative market, extracts its oracle configuration (`oracleBase`, `oracleQuote`, `oracleType`), and fetches the live oracle price for that market.

See the [spotmarket README](./spotmarket/README.md) for detailed walkthroughs and code explanations.

## Starter repo (demo)

Welcome back to day 6 of the 7 days of Injective series!
We will be interacting with Injective's spot markets using the TypeScript SDK today!

Let's get started!
Open the terminal and navigate to the `day06` directory within this repo.
This will be our workspace for exploring spot market trading.

```shell
cd day06/spotmarket/
```

Also, we'll need to install the dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

We will need to set up a `.env` file here too.
Create one with your private key and Injective address.

```shell
cp .env.sample .env
```

Open the `.env` file and fill in the following values:
- `PRIVATE`: Your wallet's private key (without 0x prefix)
- `INJECTIVE_ADDRESS`: Your Injective address (starts with `inj`)

You can get these from your wallet (e.g., Keplr or Metamask).

> **Note**  
> Do not commit `.env`, or push to remote

## Fetch market data

Before we can trade, we need to understand the markets available on Injective.
The Indexer API provides access to spot market data including tickers, denoms, and precision parameters.
These parameters are crucial for placing orders correctly.

### Understanding market parameters (demo)

Let's fetch market data to understand the structure.
Run the fetch script:

```bash
npx tsx src/fetch.ts
```

The output displays detailed information about available markets:
Because USDT has 6 decimals, so notional is 1 USDT
```bash
Min notional of INJ/USDT market: 1000000

    "priceTensMultiplier": "-3",
    "quantityTensMultiplier": "-3"
  }
]
```

Each market contains several critical parameters:
- `marketId`: Unique identifier for the trading pair
- `ticker`: Human-readable market name (e.g., "INJ/USDT")
- `baseDecimals` and `quoteDecimals`: Token precision
- `minPriceTickSize` and `minQuantityTickSize`: Minimum order increments
- `priceTensMultiplier` and `quantityTensMultiplier`: Precision adjustments for chain formatting. These multipliers are essential for converting human-readable prices to chain-compatible formats.

To query the minimum order notional for a market, you can use the SDK to fetch market details:

```typescript
const market = await indexerSpotApi.fetchMarket('0x0611780ba69656949525013d947713300f56c37b6175e02f26bffa495c3208fe')
console.log('Min notional:', market.minNotional)
```

The notional value is calculated as `price × quantity` and must meet the minimum requirement (typically 1 USDT).

## Spot limit orders

Injective's orderbook supports limit orders, allowing traders to specify exact prices.
Unlike market orders, limit orders give us full control over execution price.
The SDK provides utilities to format prices and quantities correctly for the chain.

### Price and quantity conversion

The SDK includes conversion functions to handle decimal precision:
- `spotPriceToChainPriceToFixed`: Converts human price to chain format
- `spotQuantityToChainQuantityToFixed`: Converts quantity to chain format
- `spotPriceFromChainPriceToFixed`: Converts chain price back to human-readable format

These functions account for token decimals and tens multipliers automatically.

### Create limit order message (demo)

Let's look at how to construct a limit order.
Open `src/limitorder.ts` to see the `makeMsgCreateSpotLimitOrder` function.
It takes a price, quantity, order type (1 for buy, 2 for sell), and market parameters.

```typescript
export const makeMsgCreateSpotLimitOrder = (
  price: string,
  quantity: string,
  orderType: number,
  injectiveAddress: string,
  market: Market
) => {
  const subaccountId = getDefaultSubaccountId(injectiveAddress)

  return MsgCreateSpotLimitOrder.fromJSON({
    subaccountId,
    injectiveAddress,
    orderType,
    price: spotPriceToChainPriceToFixed({
      value: price,
      tensMultiplier: market.priceTensMultiplier,
      baseDecimals: market.baseDecimals,
      quoteDecimals: market.quoteDecimals,
    }),
    quantity: spotQuantityToChainQuantityToFixed({
      value: quantity,
      baseDecimals: market.baseDecimals,
    }),
    marketId: market.marketId,
    feeRecipient: injectiveAddress,
  })
}
```

The function handles all the necessary conversions internally.
We just need to provide human-readable values.

## Place limit sell order (demo)

Time for a demo.
Let's place a sell order on the INJ/USDT market.
The script in `src/placeorder.ts` demonstrates a complete workflow.

First, ensure your `.env` file is configured with your private key and address.
Then run the script:

```bash
npx tsx src/placeorder.ts
```

The transaction response will look like this:
```bash

}

```

A successful transaction returns a `txHash` that can be viewed on the block explorer.
The `code: 0` indicates success, while any other code indicates an error.
You can track your transaction at [https://testnet.explorer.injective.network](https://testnet.explorer.injective.network).

Open the transaction in the explorer and examine the details.
Key fields to look for:
- **Status**: Shows if the transaction was successful
- **Transaction Hash**: Unique identifier for this transaction
- **Block Height**: Which block included this transaction
- **Gas Used**: How much gas was consumed
- **Messages**: The actual order creation message with price, quantity, and order type

### Query order status

After placing an order, you can query its status to see if it's been matched or is still on the orderbook.

First, update `src/status.ts` with your Injective address:

```typescript
const injectiveAddress = 'YOUR_INJ_ADDRESS_HERE'; // Replace with your address
```

Then run the script:

```shell
npx tsx src/status.ts
```

The script will display:
- **Active orders**: All open orders on the orderbook for your subaccount, showing:
  - `orderHash`: Unique identifier for the order
  - `price`: Order price
  - `quantity`: Total order quantity
  - `unfilledQuantity`: Amount remaining to be filled
  - `state`: Order status (e.g., "booked", "partial_filled", "filled", "canceled")

- **Recent trades**: Your executed trades for this market, showing:
  - `price`: Execution price
  - `quantity`: Trade size
  - `fee`: Trading fee paid
  - `executedAt`: Timestamp of execution

Example output:

```bash
Active orders: [
  {
    orderHash: '0x...',
    price: '25.5',
    quantity: '0.1',
    unfilledQuantity: '0.1',
    state: 'booked'
  }
]
Recent trades: [
  {
    price: '25.4',
    quantity: '0.05',
    fee: '0.001',
    executedAt: 1738567890123
  }
]
```

### Understanding order notional

Injective enforces a minimum order notional (price × quantity) requirement.
For most markets, this is 1 USDT equivalent.
If your order is too small, you'll see an error:

```bash
order notional (0.794400000000000000) is less than the minimum notional for the market (1.000000000000000000): invalid notional
```

To fix this, either increase your quantity or adjust your price so that `price × quantity ≥ 1`.

### Why orders may not fill immediately

If you don't see immediate asset changes in the explorer, it's because your order is sitting on the orderbook.
Limit orders only execute when someone takes the other side at your specified price.
If you price a sell order too high (above market), it won't fill until the market rises to your price.
Similarly, a buy order priced too low won't fill until the market drops to that level.

## Place limit buy order (demo)

Now let's place a buy order instead.
The only change needed is the `orderType` parameter in `makeMsgCreateSpotLimitOrder`.

Edit `src/placeorder.ts` and change the order type from `1` (buy) to `2` (sell):

```typescript
const placeOrderMsg = makeMsgCreateSpotLimitOrder(
    (bestAsk * multiplier).toString(),  // price of the asset
    "0.1",    // how much to buy/sell
    2,    // orderType (1 for Buy, 2 for Sell)
    INJECTIVE_ADDRESS,
    {
        marketId: '0x0611780ba69656949525013d947713300f56c37b6175e02f26bffa495c3208fe', // Example marketId
        baseDecimals: 18,
        quoteDecimals: 6,
        priceTensMultiplier: -3, 
        quantityTensMultiplier:-3, 
    },
);
```

Run the script again to place your sell order:

```bash
npx tsx src/placeorder.ts
```

The transaction response will be similar to the buy order.

Open the transaction in the [explorer](https://testnet.explorer.injective.network) to verify your order was placed successfully.
You should see the sell order with `orderType: 2` in the transaction details.

Query the order status to check if it's been matched:

```shell
# Use the query commands from the previous section
# Look for your order in the active orders list
```

## Get market price (demo)

To make informed trading decisions, we need current market prices.
The `getMarketPrice` function in `src/limitorder.ts` fetches the orderbook and calculates:
- Best bid (highest buy price)
- Best ask (lowest sell price)  
- Mid price (average of bid and ask)
- Spread (difference between ask and bid)

```typescript
export const getMarketPrice = async (marketId: string) => {
  try {
    const orderbook = await indexerSpotApi.fetchOrderbookV2(marketId)
    
    const bestBid = orderbook.buys[0]?.price
    const bestAsk = orderbook.sells[0]?.price
    
    let midPrice = '0'
    if (bestBid && bestAsk) {
      midPrice = ((parseFloat(bestBid) + parseFloat(bestAsk)) / 2).toString()
    } else if (bestBid) {
      midPrice = bestBid
    } else if (bestAsk) {
      midPrice = bestAsk
    }

    return {
      bestBid: bestBid || '0',
      bestAsk: bestAsk || '0',
      midPrice,
      spread: bestBid && bestAsk ? (parseFloat(bestAsk) - parseFloat(bestBid)).toString() : '0'
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching market price:', error)
    throw error
  }
}
```

This function is useful for:
- Determining competitive order prices
- Calculating slippage
- Market analysis and monitoring

## Convert chain price to price (demo)

When fetching data from the chain, prices come in chain format.
We need to convert them back to human-readable format.
The `convertChainPriceToPrice` function handles this:

```typescript
export const convertChainPriceToPrice = (
  chainPrice: string,
  tensMultiplier: number,
  baseDecimals: number,
  quoteDecimals: number,
) => {
  return spotPriceFromChainPriceToFixed({
    value: chainPrice,
    tensMultiplier,
    baseDecimals,
    quoteDecimals,
  })
}
```

This is the inverse of `spotPriceToChainPriceToFixed`.
Use it when processing orderbook data, trade history, or any chain-returned price values.

## Complete!

Congratulations on completing this.
You now know how to:
- Fetch spot market data
- Understand market parameters and precision
- Place limit buy and sell orders
- Get current market prices
- Convert between chain and human-readable formats
